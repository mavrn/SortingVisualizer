# Sorting algorithm visualizer

**Installation:**<br>
There are two ways to run the program:
- Install ursina and numpy as mentioned in requirements.txt. Then, download/clone the source code and run main.py with Python 3.9+. 
- Download Sorting Visualizer.rar from the release section, unpack the archive and run Sorting Visualizer.bat. 

Having sounds enabled will slow down the sorting process by ~100%. Running the program with the second method (Ursina build) will avoid this.
